\begin{theorem}
Let $f$ be a function whose derivative exists in every point, then $f$ is
a continuous function.
\end{theorem}

\begin{theorem}[Pythagorean theorem]\label{the:pythagorean}
This is a theorema about right triangles and can be summarised in the next
equation
\begin{equation*}
  x^2 + y^2 = z^2
\end{equation*}
\end{theorem}

And a consequence of theorem \ref{the:pythagorean} is the statement in the next
corollary.

\begin{corollary}
There's no right rectangle whose sides measure 3cm, 4cm, and 6cm.
\end{corollary}

You can reference theorems such as \ref{the:pythagorean} when a label is assigned.

Given two line segments whose lengths are $a$ and $b$ respectively there is a
real number $r$ such that $b=ra$.
